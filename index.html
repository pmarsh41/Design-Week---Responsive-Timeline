Aluminum Is Beautiful, Utility Objects 1930-1970
An exhibition curated by Don Browne
The twentieth century ushered in the industrial age, the aircraft age and later the space age. In this period of mass production, aluminum was a material with driving force. The rapidly rising use of aluminum in industry spawned the production of countless utilitarian designs that introduced the material to everyday living. This rare exhibit, curated by Don Browne, explores through objects and industry photographs the way aluminum contributed to the quality of life.

Don Browne is a well-known longtime collector, design historian, and dealer of twentieth century decorative art and design. His early specialization in mid-century modern and a growing public interest in the period has led to occasions to produce a series of exhibitions featuring pieces he has selected from his collections.
